Your book library has been upgraded from CSS 3D transforms to **WebGL-based Three.js rendering**. This gives you:

- üé® Realistic lighting from a fireplace HDRI environment
- ü™µ Photorealistic wooden shelves
- üìö 3D books with random sizes and category-based colors
- ‚ú® Smooth animations when opening books
- üñ±Ô∏è Interactive camera controls (orbit, zoom)
- üîç All your filters and sorting still work perfectly

## Key Code Locations

### Adding a New Book
Books are managed in localStorage through the admin panel:
- Go to `http://localhost:8000/admin.html`
- Add/edit/delete books
- Changes automatically sync to the 3D view

### Changing Book Colors
Edit category colors in `js/Book3D.js`:
```javascript
getCategoryColor(category) {
  const categoryColors = {
    'ai': 0x4a90e2,        // Blue
    'self-help': 0xf39c12, // Orange
    'business': 0x27ae60,  // Green
    'science': 0x9b59b6,   // Purple
    'horror': 0xe74c3c,    // Red
    'dystopian': 0x34495e, // Dark gray
  };
  return categoryColors[category] || 0x95a5a6;
}
```

### Adjusting Lighting
Edit lighting in `js/bookshelf3D.js` ‚Üí `setupLighting()` method:
```javascript
const ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff, 0.4);
const dirLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffd9b3, 1.2);
const fireplaceLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xff6633, 1.5, 30);
// etc.
```

### Changing Camera Position
Edit in `js/bookshelf3D.js` ‚Üí constructor:
```javascript
this.camera.position.set(0, 1, 14); // x, y, z
```

### Adjusting Animation Speed
Edit in `js/Book3D.js` ‚Üí `update()` method:
```javascript
const lerpFactor = 0.1; // Lower = slower, Higher = faster (0-1)
```

---

## Customization Examples

### Example 1: Change Books Per Shelf
In `bookLibrary.js`:
```javascript
this.booksPerShelf = 8; // Change from 6 to 8
```

### Example 2: Make Books Pull Out Further
In `bookshelf3D.js` ‚Üí `openBook()`:
```javascript
targetPosition.z += 3; // Change from 2 to 3
```

### Example 3: Add More Rotation When Opening
In `bookshelf3D.js` ‚Üí `openBook()`:
```javascript
const targetRotation = new THREE.Euler(0, 0.4, 0); // Change from 0.2 to 0.4
```

### Example 4: Change Fireplace Light Color
In `bookshelf3D.js` ‚Üí `setupLighting()`:
```javascript
const fireplaceLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xff9933, 1.5, 30); // Warmer orange
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Black screen / Nothing shows up
**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Ensure HDRI file exists: `assets/Fireplace 4K.hdr`
3. Verify wood texture exists: `assets/Dark Wood Texture/textures/dark_wood_diff_4k.jpg`
4. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)

### Issue: Books don't appear
**Solutions:**
1. Check that `bookLibrary` initialized: Open console, type `window.bookLibrary`
2. Check books exist in localStorage: Go to `admin.html` and verify
3. Look for errors in console

### Issue: Can't click on books
**Solutions:**
1. Ensure raycaster is working (check console for "Book clicked:" messages)
2. Verify canvas is receiving mouse events
3. Check that `#bookshelf-3d-container` is visible

### Issue: Performance is slow
**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce shadow quality**: In `bookshelf3D.js`:
   ```javascript
   dirLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 1024; // Instead of 2048
   dirLight.shadow.mapSize.height = 1024;
   ```
2. **Lower HDRI quality**: Use a smaller HDRI file
3. **Reduce book count**: Display fewer books initially

### Issue: Text on spines is blurry
**Solutions:**
1. **Increase canvas resolution**: In `Book3D.js`:
   ```javascript
   canvas.width = 1024;  // Instead of 512
   canvas.height = 4096; // Instead of 2048
   ```

---

## Performance Tips

### For Desktop
- Keep shadow quality at 2048x2048
- Use full 4K textures
- Enable all lights

### For Mobile/Low-End Devices
- Reduce shadow quality to 1024x1024
- Use 1K textures instead of 4K
- Disable some lights (remove rim light, reduce fireplace light)
- Lower camera distance limits

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Add Book Covers**: Create texture images for book fronts
2. **Improve Text**: Use signed distance field fonts for sharper text
3. **Add Hover Effects**: Glow effect when hovering over books
4. **Page Flipping Animation**: Animated pages when opening books
5. **Search Functionality**: Search by title/author and highlight results

### Advanced Features
1. **VR Support**: Enable WebXR for VR viewing
2. **Physics**: Add realistic book physics with cannon.js
3. **Post-Processing**: Add bloom, depth of field effects
4. **Dynamic Covers**: Generate covers from book data
